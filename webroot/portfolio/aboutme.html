					Introduction
				</h3>
						<p>
							Hi, my name is Faris; I'm a first year student of Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London.
						</p>

					</section>

					<section id = "Why Computer Science?">
					<h3>
						Why Computer Science?
					</h3>
					<p>
						Early on, I was always passionate about solving problems and was drawn towards maths. Later, I was
						introduced to programming and discrete mathematics which eventually drew me towards studying computer science.
					</p>
					<p>
						Extract from personal statement: "Since first being introduced to computers and the internet, Iâ€™ve had a fascination with how they work, what they can be used for and what the future holds for them. My motivation for pursuing the subject is further driven by my passion for problem solving and the amount of creative freedom associated with the subject. "</p>
